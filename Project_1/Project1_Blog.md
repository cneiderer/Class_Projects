# Project Benson
## Exploring NYC MTA Turnsile Data

### Background Info
Project Benson consists of playing the part of a data science consultant to the WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY), whose charter is to increase support and awareness for women in technology.  After your initial contact at a recent event, you received a proposal to assist the organization with the placement of their street teams leading up to their annual summer gala.

### Approach
After receiving the proposal, my partner and I broke the project down into 3 parts:
1. Defining of objectives and assumptions. 
2. Data identification and sourcing.
3. Data exploration and recommendations.

### Part 1:
Thor
#### Objectives
Optimize Placement of WTWY street teams to:
* Increase attendance at their annual summer gala.
* Attract potential donors to the organization.

#### Assumptions
* WYWT annual gala will be held mid-June 2018.
* Street team canvassing will target March through June 2018 timeframe.
* Target demographic:
    * Higher Education (bachelors degree or higher)
    * Techology Workers (engineers, scientists, researchers, etc.)
    * Wealthy Donors (yearly income greater than $200K)

### Part 2:
The WTWY client identified NYC MTA turnsile data as their primary data source of interest.  Because the insights available within the MTA turnsile data are limited mainly to foot traffic counts, we spent some time brainstorming and searching the web for potential data sources that would we could link to the MTA data to identify those stations most closely associated with the target demographic.  Our search led to several additional data sets: American Community Survey data from the US Census Bureau, startup data from Digital NYC and Built in NYC, and technology Meetups in NYC.

#### Data Description
* NYC MTA Turnsile Data:
    * Entry and exit counts for every turnstile in the NYC MTA system for roughly the last six years.
    * Recorded approximately every four hours starting at 12AM (i.e., 12AM, 4AM, 8AM, 12PM, 4PM, 8PM)
* NYC ACS Census Data:
    * Demographic information for the last five years.
* NYC Startup Locations
