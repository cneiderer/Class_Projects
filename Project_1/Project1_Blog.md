# Project Benson
## Exploring NYC MTA Turnsile Data

### Background Info
Project Benson consists of playing the part of a data science consultant to the WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY), whose charter is to increase support and awareness for women in technology.  After your initial contact at a recent event, you received a proposal to assist the organization with the placement of their street teams leading up to their annual summer gala.

### Approach
After reviewing the proposal, my partner and I broke the project down into 3 parts:
1. Defining the underlying objectives and assumptions. 
2. Identifying and obtaining the necessary data sources.
3. Performing exploratory analysis to provide placement recommendations.

### Problem Statement
#### Objectives:
Optimize Placement of WTWY street teams to:
1. Increase attendance at their annual summer gala.
2. Attract potential donors to the organization.

#### Assumptions:
* WYWT annual gala will be held mid-June 2018.
* Street team canvassing will target March through June 2018 timeframe.
* Target demographic:
    * Higher Education (bachelors degree or higher)
    * Techology Workers (engineers, scientists, researchers, etc.)
    * Wealthy Donors (yearly income greater than $200K)

### Data Sources:
* NYC MTA Turnsile Data:
    * Entry and exit counts for every turnstile in the NYC MTA system.
    * Recorded approximately every four hours starting at 12AM (i.e., 12AM, 4AM, 8AM, 12PM, 4PM, 8PM)
